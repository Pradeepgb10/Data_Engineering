# Data Modeling with Postgres

Udacity Data Engineering Nano Degree project

## Introduction
A startup called Sparkify wants to analyze the data they've been collecting on songs and user activity on their new music streaming app. The analytics team is particularly interested in understanding what songs users are listening to. Currently, they don't have an easy way to query their data, which resides in a directory of JSON logs on user activity on the app, as well as a directory with JSON metadata on the songs in their app.

They'd like a data engineer to create a Postgres database with tables designed to optimize queries on song play analysis, and bring you on the project. Your role is to create a database schema and ETL pipeline for this analysis. You'll be able to test your database and ETL pipeline by running queries given to you by the analytics team from Sparkify and compare your results with their expected results.

## Project Description
In this project, we build an ETL pipeline using Python. To complete the project, you will need to define fact and dimension tables for a star schema for a particular analytic focus, and write an ETL pipeline that transfers data from files in two local directories into these tables in Postgres using Python and SQL.

## Getting started

`python create_tables.py`</br>
`python etl.py`

## Python scripts

- create_tables.py: Clean previous schema and creates tables.
- sql_queries.py: All queries used in the ETL pipeline.
- etl.py: Read JSON logs and JSON metadata and load the data into generated tables.

## Database Schema
![ERD](DEND%20Project%201%20ERD.png)

- songplays: Records in log data associated with song plays
- users: Users in the app
- songs: Songs in music database
- artists: Artists in music database
- time: Timestamps of records in songplays broken down into specific units

## ETL Pipeline Details


### song_data ETL

#### Source dataset
Each file is in JSON format and contains metadata about a song and the artist of that song. The files are partitioned by the first three letters of each song's track ID. For example, here are filepaths to two files in this dataset.

`song_data/A/B/C/TRABCEI128F424C983.json
song_data/A/A/B/TRAABJL12903CDCF1A.json
`

And below is an example of what a single song file, TRAABJL12903CDCF1A.json, looks like.
```json
{
  "num_songs": 1,
  "artist_id": "ARJIE2Y1187B994AB7",
  "artist_latitude": null,
  "artist_longitude": null,
  "artist_location": "",
  "artist_name": "Line Renaud",
  "song_id": "SOUPIRU12A6D4FA1E1",
  "title": "Der Kleine Dompfaff",
  "duration": 152.92036,
  "year": 0
}
```

#### Final tabes
- songs table: Save song ID, title, artist ID, year, and duration from dataset

| song_id            | title                          | artist_id          | year | duration  |
|--------------------|--------------------------------|--------------------|------|-----------|
| SOFNOQK12AB01840FC | Kutt Free (DJ Volume Remix)    | ARNNKDK1187B98BBD5 | -    | 407.37914 |
| SOFFKZS12AB017F194 | A Higher Place (Album Version) | ARBEBBY1187B9B43DB | 1994 | 236.17261 |

- artist table: Save artist ID, name, location, latitude, and longitude from dataset

| artist_id          | name      | location        | lattitude | longitude |
|--------------------|-----------|-----------------|-----------|-----------|
| ARNNKDK1187B98BBD5 | Jinx      | Zagreb Croatia  | 45.80726  | 15.9676   |
| ARBEBBY1187B9B43DB | Tom Petty | Gainesville, FL | -         | -         |


### log_data ETL

#### Source dataset
The log files in the dataset you'll be working with are partitioned by year and month. For example, here are filepaths to two files in this dataset.

`log_data/2018/11/2018-11-12-events.json
log_data/2018/11/2018-11-13-events.json
`

And below is an example of what the data in a log file, 2018-11-12-events.json, looks like.
```json
{
  "artist": "Pavement",
  "auth": "Logged In",
  "firstName": "Sylvie",
  "gender": "F",
  "itemInSession": 0,
  "lastName": "Cruz",
  "length": 99.16036,
